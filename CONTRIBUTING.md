# Contributing

## Getting started
Start by cloning the project and make sure that it is able to build and all tests are green.

## Commiting
This repository uses automated deployment and versioning. To do this we use the tool [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) which analyses commit messages to determine a release and generate a changelog. The commit message format we use is [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary). Please use this format for all commit messages to ensure correct versioning and changelog generation.

## Create pull request
When the bug have been solved or the feature added (and tested!) create a Pull Request. This will do testing and your contribution is ready for review.
